# Scorched Earth

Game based on [https://github.com/stimm78/ScorchedEarth](https://github.com/stimm78/ScorchedEarth), but written in Rust (with some nice terminal graphics too)

Move the current player with WASD keys, and leave behind scorched cells everywhere you have previously moved. You lose if the other player moves on top of you or you become surrounded by scorched cells.
